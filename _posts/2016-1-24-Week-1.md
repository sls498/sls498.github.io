Oh look! It's finally working!

After several hours of installing dependencies and performing a little sysadmin magic; I finally have my environment set up and ready to take on the challenge of Downing's software engineering course. I know that I could have saved myself a lot of time if I had just connected to one of the CS lab machines, but I feel that setting up a development environment is a valuable learning experience that every computer science student should master before graduation. 

In an effort to encourage my fellow students to accept the challenge of setting up their own development environment, here are some of the problems that I encountered and how I remedied them. After all, we can't always depend on someone else setting up the environment for us.
