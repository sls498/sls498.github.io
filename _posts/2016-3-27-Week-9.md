<h2>Questions for the Week</h2>
<hr></hr>
<ul><li><b>What did you do this past week?</b></i>
<br><br>Completing the first phase of the IMDB project was my main focus for the last two weeks and, so far, has not been a very positive experience for me. While working with a new team always has its challenges that need to be over come; the multitude of development tools, which are relatively unfamiliar to everyone in my team, caused us to struggle much more than I was anticipating. I had volunteered to be part of the front end group for my team; however, I spent the majority of time working with Carina and trying to work out the deployment kinks.

Currently the lack of communication in my group is blocking my progress.

I have absolutely no idea.

<h2>Tip for the Week</h2>
<hr></hr>
<br>When being asked to develop with a tool that you have never used before, DO THE TUTORIALS! There are a plethora of tutorials online to help developers understand how to implement and use just about every development tool in existence; and if you can't find decent documentation for a development tool, then you should probably consider using something else.
