<h2>Questions for the Week</h2>
<hr></hr>
<ul><li><b>What did you do this past week?</b></i>
<br><br>I know I've missed a couple weeks on my blog, but now I'm back.<br>
Last week was a week of firsts; my first Downing exam, my first exam administered via Canvas, and my first meeting with my group for the IMDB project. I really don't think I did very well on the exam since I did not pace myself correctly. I still had yet to start answering the last 3 programming questions when it was announced that there was only 20 minutes left of the exam. I panicked and did what I could, but I am not confident about my answers.
<br><br>
<li><b>What's in your way?</b></i>
<br><br>Right now I am waiting for Downing to post the IMDB project. I have met with my group and we are all ready to hit the ground running.

<br><br>
<li><b>What will you do next week?</b></i>
<br><br>Next week I will meet with my group and arrange meeting times since this project will span spring break.

<br>Be humble. Everyone is at different points of learning in their career. Help others on their path. Ask for help when you need it. Give back to the community.
